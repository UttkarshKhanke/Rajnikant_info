<h1>Rajinikanth - Indian Film Icon</h1>

<p>Rajinikanth, originally named Shivaji Rao Gaekwad, was born on December 12, 1950, in Bangalore, Mysore State (now Karnataka), India. His father, Ramoji Rao Gaekwad, was a police constable, and his mother, Jijabai, was a housewife. Rajinikanth grew up in a modest family.</p>

<p>Before entering the film industry, Rajinikanth worked in various odd jobs, including as a coolie and a bus conductor in Bangalore Transport Service. During his time as a bus conductor, he developed an interest in acting and participated in various stage plays. His talent was noticed by K. Balachander, a renowned filmmaker, who gave him his first break in the Tamil film "Apoorva Raagangal" in 1975.</p>

<p>Rajinikanth's early career saw him playing negative and character roles, gradually establishing himself as a versatile actor. However, it was the film "Mullum Malarum" (1978) that marked a turning point in his career, showcasing his ability to carry a film as the lead actor.</p>

<p>Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Rajinikanth's popularity soared with a string of successful films. His unique style, dialogue delivery, and on-screen mannerisms endeared him to a wide audience. Some of his iconic movies from this period include "Muthu," "Sivaji," and "Endhiran."</p>

<p>Apart from his film career, Rajinikanth has been involved in philanthropic activities. He is also known for his spiritual beliefs and practices. Over the years, he has become not just a film star but a cultural icon in India.</p>

<p>Rajinikanth's influence goes beyond the boundaries of Tamil cinema, and he enjoys a pan-Indian fan following. His fans fondly refer to him as "Thalaivar," a term in Tamil meaning "Leader" or "Boss." Despite his massive success, Rajinikanth is known for his humility and down-to-earth personality.</p>
