    <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold mb-4">Rajinikanth - Indian Film Icon</h1>

    <p class="mb-4">Rajinikanth, originally named Shivaji Rao Gaekwad, was born on December 12, 1950, in Bangalore, Mysore State (now Karnataka), India. His father, Ramoji Rao Gaekwad, was a police constable, and his mother, Jijabai, was a housewife. Rajinikanth grew up in a modest family.</p>

    <p class="mb-4">Before entering the film industry, Rajinikanth worked in various odd jobs, including as a coolie and a bus conductor in Bangalore Transport Service. During his time as a bus conductor, he developed an interest in acting and participated in various stage plays. His talent was noticed by K. Balachander, a renowned filmmaker, who gave him his first break in the Tamil film "Apoorva Raagangal" in 1975.</p>

    <p class="mb-4">Rajinikanth's early career saw him playing negative and character roles, gradually establishing himself as a versatile actor. However, it was the film "Mullum Malarum" (1978) that marked a turning point in his career, showcasing his ability to carry a film as the lead actor.</p>

    <p class="mb-4">Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Rajinikanth's popularity soared with a string of successful films. His unique style, dialogue delivery, and on-screen mannerisms endeared him to a wide audience. Some of his iconic movies from this period include "Muthu," "Sivaji," and "Endhiran."</p>

    <p class="mb-4">Apart from his film career, Rajinikanth has been involved in philanthropic activities. He is also known for his spiritual beliefs and practices. Over the years, he has become not just a film star but a cultural icon in India.</p>

    <p class="mb-4">Rajinikanth's influence goes beyond the boundaries of Tamil cinema, and he enjoys a pan-Indian fan following. His fans fondly refer to him as "Thalaivar," a term in Tamil meaning "Leader" or "Boss." Despite his massive success, Rajinikanth is known for his humility and down-to-earth personality.</p>

    <p class="mb-4">It's important to note that information provided here is accurate up until my last knowledge update in January 2022, and there may have been further developments in Rajinikanth's life or career since then.</p>
