    <p class="mb-4">As of my last knowledge update in January 2022, Rajinikanth is not known to have personal social media accounts. However, there are official social media accounts and pages associated with him or managed by his team. These accounts are used to share updates about his professional work, public appearances, and other relevant information.</p>

    <p class="mb-4">If you're looking for the most accurate and up-to-date information, it's recommended to check official sources. You can look for official websites, verified social media profiles, or statements from Rajinikanth's management team.</p>

    <p class="mb-4">Please note that the availability and details of social media accounts can change over time, so it's a good idea to verify this information through official and reliable sources.</p>
